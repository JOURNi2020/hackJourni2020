<h1>
    Neighborhood Watch
  </h1>


<P id="starter" class="padding"> The reason I feel as though we should have a neighborhood watch is because it would be a good way to keep the community safe and out of danger. Me and my team came up with some great suggestions on how we could do this all together where everybody have A part.</P>


<div id="meeting">
  <p>We thought it would be a good idea to sit the neighborhood down and have a meeting so we can come up with a part everybody can play and different ideas people had in mind to keep the neighborhood safe. </p>

</div>


<p class="padding"> We wanna make it to where people can be able to walk alone and not be so afraid that something is going to happen.They will feel good knowing that its people watching out for any suspicious activity. Where you can be notified about it and either go straight home or have someone walk with you. </p>
