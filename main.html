         <p>
           Walking alone can be very scary and dangerous especially for women and if you feel this way you’re not alone. 

           Many women say that they avoid a nighttime event because they don't want to travel home alone afterward, or an evening jog 
           because of running at night. When doing something simple like going place-to-place, women experience more fear on a larger 
           scale than men, according to the studies. In 27 out of 28 everyday life scenarios, a larger percentage of women indicated 
           more fear. Scott Clement, a polling analyst at The Washington Post, found one data set that begins to 
           speak about how many fear walking alone.</p>

           <br>
           
            <p> A study from the law firm Farah and Farah showed 22.5% women fear walking alone while 11.0% of man fear the same. when walking alone, 58.4% of all women feel much safer when holding keys 
            between their fingers this is a common safety precaution that can be used to defend oneself. Other women said they took precautions 
            like carrying a rock or hammer in their purse, changing a previously walked route, crossing the street, and avoiding eye contact with 
            people. Women also indicate they feel safer when they text or call someone when walking. Even though there are few men who fear walking alone 
            there is still the 11.0% in fact some men have said that they feel unsafe on few situations when there is a dangerous vibe about a man or group of men 
            approaching, in which case to make sure to not do anything to challenge them, like stare aggressively at them, or get in their way.No one can really know if someone
            is safe or not so it's best to always be on alert both women and men. </P>

            <p>Its common for women to fear men when walking alone so here are some ways men can make women feel more safe.
            The first step is for men to realize and accept the reality of women. Girls are trained to be highly aware that when 
            in public alone many things can happen, So as soon as we leave the house all incoming objects/creatures/shadows can be a threat.
            That means that if you’re a guy walking behind a woman at night, you will be a beeping red dot on her radar. Even if you are just walking in the same way.
            How can you make her not think you are following her or want to cause her harm simple don’t start walking faster and rapidly close up on her from behind. The best thing to do is cross 
            to the other side of the road, walk faster until you’re out of site, and then cross back over if you have to. Or let’s say you have to walk behind her. Pull out
            your phone and talk to someone to reassure her that you’re a normal person who has normal friends and normal loved ones. Or you could simply wait longer until 
            she’s well ahead before you start walking so she feels at a safe distance. Lastly please dont get offended by the need for you to do this. Please understand that
            women aren’t afraid of you because you specifically have done something wrong but because they have either experience or just know that there are bad men in the 
            world as well bad women.</p>
