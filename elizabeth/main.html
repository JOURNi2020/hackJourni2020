           Walking alone can be very scary and dangerous especially for women and if you feel this way you’re not alone. 

           Many women say that they avoid a nighttime event because they don't want to travel home alone afterward, or an evening jog 
           because of running at night. When doing something simple like going place-to-place, women experience more fear on a larger 
           scale than men, according to the studies. In 27 out of 28 everyday life scenarios, a larger percentage of women indicated 
           more fear. Scott Clement, a polling analyst at The Washington Post, found one data set that begins to 
           speak about how many fear walking alone.</p>

            <p> A study from the law firm Farah and Farah showed when walking alone, 58.4% of all women feel much safer when holding keys 
            between their fingers this is a common safety precaution that can be used to defend oneself. Other women said they took precautions 
            like carrying a rock or hammer in their purse, changing a previously walked route, crossing the street, and avoiding eye contact with 
            people. Women also indicate they feel safer when they text or call someone when walking.</P>
